# C2-Week05-Python-Challenge
I wrote a poem as a Python challenge. The design inspiration came from the ancient Chinese poetry form known as "Cangtou Poem," where the first character of each line can be combined to form a hidden message. In my poem, I concealed the sentence "You are like a star" within a romantic piece expressing emotions. The clues were hidden in my mind, with each line's first letter forming part of the puzzle's solution. By extracting the first letter of each sentence in the entire text, the message "You are like a star" can be revealed, creating a romantic expression.
